# Seattle Accessibility Data Analysis & Prediction

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models to predict accessibility scores based on various features.

A comprehensive machine learning project that analyzes and predicts accessibility issues in Seattle neighborhoods. It includes data preprocessing, analysis identifying high-risk areas, and prediction models to indicate the severity of accessibility barriers.

## Problem Statement
Urban accessibility issues (surface problems, obstacles, missing curb ramps, etc.) impact millions of people with disabilities and other mobility barriers. This project helps cities:
- Prioritize infrastructure repairs based on predicted severity
- Identify neighborhoods requiring immediate attention
- Allocate resources efficiently to improve accessibility

## Addresses critical urban accessibility challenges by:
- **Clustering** accessibility issues to identify problem hotspots
- **Analyzing** neighborhood-level accessibility patterns
- **Predicting** severity of accessibility barriers using machine learning
- **Visualizing** results through interactive maps and insights

## Key Features

### 1. Spatial Clustering (DBSCAN)
Identifies geographic clusters of accessibility issues to detect problem hotspots across the city.

### 2. Neighborhood Analysis (K-Means)
Groups neighborhoods based on:
- Issue density and count
- Average severity
- Cluster concentration
- Proportion of temporary vs. permanent issues

### 3. Predictive Modeling (Random Forest)
Predicts severity of accessibility issues using:
- Geographic location (lat/lon)
- Neighborhood context (issue density, average severity)
- Issue type (SurfaceProblem, Obstacle, CurbRamp, etc.)
- Temporal status (temporary vs. permanent)

### 4. Interactive Visualization & Gradient
Generates color-coded accessibility maps where:
- 🟢 **Green** = Most accessible (safest, fewest issues)
- 🟡 **Yellow** = Moderate accessibility
- 🔴 **Red** = Least accessible (most dangerous, highest issue concentration)

## Core Technologies:
- **Data Processing:** pandas, geopandas
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (DBSCAN, K-Means, Random Forest, StandardScaler)
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, folium

## Model Performance:

#### Evaluation Metrics

Our Random Forest model demonstrates high stability and predictive power, as evidenced by the minimal gap between training and testing performance.

| Metric | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model Accuracy (MAPE)** | **73.85%** | Average proximity of predictions to actual values. |
| **Margin of Error (MAE)** | **0.5455** | Average absolute deviation in score units. |
| **Test $R²$ Score** | **0.7014** | Explains ~70% of the variance in neighborhood accessibility. |
| **Test RMSE** | **0.7200** | Root Mean Square Error; sensitive to larger outliers. |


#### Elbow Method Analysis
![Elbow Method](elbow_method.png)

The elbow method helps determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting inertia (cluster compactness) against number of clusters. The "elbow point" indicates where adding more clusters provides diminishing returns.

#### Silhouette Analysis
![Silhouette Analysis](silhouette_analysis.png)

Silhouette scores measure how well-separated clusters are:
- **Score close to 1**: Well-defined, distinct clusters
- **Score close to 0**: Overlapping clusters
- **Negative score**: Potential misclassification

The optimal k is automatically selected based on the highest silhouette score.

### Predictive Model Results

#### Feature Importance
![Feature Importance](feature_importance.png)

This chart reveals which factors most strongly predict accessibility issue severity. Key insights:
- **Neighborhood context** (average severity nearby, issue density) often dominates
- **Geographic location** (latitude/longitude) captures spatial patterns
- **Issue type** (SurfaceProblem vs. CurbRamp) affects severity differently
